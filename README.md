Hi there!
----------

My name is Hans Kruger.

I am a senior software engineer, with a strong background designing and building global cloud-based services. My most recent experience is in the Payments industry. 

I get a kick from solving hairy business problems with software. I like to modernise and improve cloud-based services, while focussing on excellence and industry best practices.

Seriously, who doesn't, right?
