Hi there!
----------

I am a software engineer who loves to "play Lego with software". 

I have a passion to build systems and infrastructure that scale globally using the cloud, and see it run like clockwork in real life, for the benefit of delighted clients and businesses alike.

Seriously, who doesn't like Lego, right?
